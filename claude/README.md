# Claude Code Configuration

This directory manages Claude Code configuration files.

## How It Works

Running `make stow-claude` creates symlinks from `claude/` into `~/.claude/`. For example:

- `claude/settings.json` → `~/.claude/settings.json`
- `claude/skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md` → `~/.claude/skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md`

This means every Claude Code session on your machine picks up these settings, skills, and agents automatically.

## Structured Development Workflow

A workflow for reliably turning ideas into pull requests, adapted from [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers).

```
/brainstorming → /writing-plans → /executing-plans → /verifying-work → /completing-work
```

**Use the structured workflow** when:

- Building a significant feature that spans multiple files
- You want independent code reviews after each task
- The implementation would benefit from upfront design discussion

**Use Claude Code's built-in planning mode** when:

- Making smaller, well-defined changes
- The scope is clear and doesn't need exploration

## Hooks

| Hook                         | Event        | Matcher     | Description                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scan-secrets-before-commit` | PreToolUse   | Bash        | Runs gitleaks on staged changes before `git commit`; blocks the commit if secrets are found |
| `format-on-write`            | PostToolUse  | Edit, Write | Auto-formats files after edits using Prettier, gofmt, rustfmt, or shfmt based on extension  |
| Notification sound           | Notification | all         | Sends a macOS notification and plays a sound when Claude needs attention                    |
| Stop sound                   | Stop         | all         | Sends a macOS notification and plays a sound when Claude finishes                           |

## Status Line

A custom powerline-style status line (`scripts/statusline.sh`) configured via `settings.json`. Displays:

| Segment    | Description                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model      | Current model name; green background when git is clean, yellow when dirty                      |
| Directory  | Working directory name                                                                         |
| Git branch | Branch name with compact status (ahead/behind, staged, modified counts)                        |
| Context    | Context window usage percentage; color shifts white → yellow → orange → red as usage increases |
| Session    | 5-hour rolling rate limit usage; same color scale as context                                   |

The sandbox variant (`scripts/statusline-sandbox.sh`) adds a purple "sandbox" badge prefix.

## Sandbox

The `sandbox/` directory provides overrides for Claude Code's [sandbox mode](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/security#sandbox-mode) (remote/headless environments). When running in a sandbox, these files replace the default configuration.

### Overrides

| File                            | Purpose                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sandbox/settings.json`         | Sandbox-specific settings; skips dangerous-mode prompt, removes allow/deny lists |
| `sandbox/CLAUDE.md`             | Simplified instructions for the sandbox environment                              |
| `scripts/statusline-sandbox.sh` | Status line variant with a "sandbox" prefix badge                                |

### Additional Hooks

These hooks are only active in the sandbox (configured in `sandbox/settings.json`):

| Hook                         | Event      | Matcher | Description                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `deny-gh-cli-in-sandbox`     | PreToolUse | Bash    | Blocks `gh` CLI commands; directs to MCP tools instead            |
| `deny-git-remote-in-sandbox` | PreToolUse | Bash    | Blocks `git push/pull/fetch/remote`; directs to MCP tools instead |

The sandbox also inherits `scan-secrets-before-commit` and `format-on-write` from the main hooks.
