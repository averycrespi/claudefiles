# Creating Skills

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools.

## Skill Structure

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter: name, description (required)
│   └── Markdown instructions (required)
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/      - Executable code for deterministic/repeated tasks
    ├── references/   - Documentation loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/       - Files used in output (templates, images, etc.)
```

## Naming Convention

- **Workflow skills** (invoked to perform a task): use gerund form (e.g., `brainstorming`, `reviewing-prs`)
- **Reference skills** (provide information/context): use nouns (e.g., `playwright-cli`, `tdd`)

## SKILL.md Frontmatter

The `name` and `description` determine when Claude activates the skill. Descriptions should start with "Use when" followed by a specific, narrow trigger condition. Overly broad descriptions cause false activations.

## Progressive Disclosure

Skills use three levels of context loading:

1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - Loaded when skill triggers (<5k words)
3. **Bundled resources** - Loaded as needed by Claude

## Writing Style

Write using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person. Use objective, instructional language (e.g., "To accomplish X, do Y" rather than "You should do X").

## Creation Process

### 1. Understand Usage

Gather concrete examples of how the skill will be used. Ask about trigger conditions, expected workflows, and edge cases. Skip only when usage patterns are already clearly understood.

### 2. Plan Contents

For each example, identify what reusable resources (scripts, references, assets) would help when executing the workflow repeatedly. Prefer references files for detailed information to keep SKILL.md lean.

### 3. Create the Skill

Create the skill directory and SKILL.md with proper frontmatter. Add any bundled resources identified in the planning step. The SKILL.md should answer:

1. What is the purpose of the skill?
2. When should it be used?
3. How should Claude use it, including references to any bundled resources?

### 4. Iterate

Use the skill on real tasks, notice struggles or inefficiencies, update SKILL.md or bundled resources, and test again.
