# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when running inside the sandbox VM.

## Sandbox Environment

You are running inside an isolated Linux VM (Ubuntu 24.04). You have full
permissions — install packages, run any commands, use Docker freely. There
are no permission prompts or hooks.

This VM has no access to host services, secrets, or API keys beyond what
is needed to run Claude Code itself. Do not attempt to access external
services that require authentication.

## Conventional Commits

Always use conventional commits when writing commit messages:

**Format:**
```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]
```

**Common Types:**
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks, dependencies
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `refactor` - Code restructuring without behavior change
- `test` - Adding/updating tests

**Best Practices:**
- Keep subject line under 50 characters
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- No period at end of subject
- Separate subject and body with blank line
