# \_shared

Shared helpers for Pi extensions in this repository.

This directory is intentionally loader-inert: do not add an `index.ts` or `package.json`. Sibling extensions import individual modules directly, for example `../_shared/render.ts`, and Pi's extension loader skips this directory because it has no extension entrypoint.

Keep shared conventions aligned with the repo's Pi extension guidance in `AGENTS.md`.

## Modules

- `config.ts` — reads Pi settings files, extracts `extension:<name>` settings, merges defaults/global/project/environment config, parses boolean environment overrides, and registers masked `/EXTENSION-NAME-config` inspection commands.
- `logging.ts` — creates managed temp logs under `${tmpdir()}/pi-extension-logs/<extensionName>/`, with sanitized unique filenames and explicit deletion support.
- `render.ts` — compact rendering utilities for tool calls/results, including elapsed partial timers, width-aware truncated text, path labels, command labels, and common text extraction helpers.
- `spillover.ts` — large-output spill-to-file helper. It joins text blocks, writes oversized text to a temp file, returns a preview envelope that references the full file, preserves image blocks inline, and falls back to original content on write failure.

## Spillover behavior

`spillover.ts` uses these defaults:

- `THRESHOLD_CHARS = 25_000`
- `PREVIEW_BYTES = 2_000`
- `SPILL_DIR = join(tmpdir(), "pi-extension-spillover")`

When joined text content exceeds the threshold, the full joined text is written to `<SPILL_DIR>/<toolCallId>.txt` with the `wx` flag. Returned content replaces text blocks with a single `<persisted-output>` envelope at the first text-block position; non-text blocks such as images are preserved. If writing fails, the original content is returned unchanged.
