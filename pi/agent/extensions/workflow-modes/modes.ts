## Goal

<One sentence describing the intended outcome.>

## Constraints

- <Hard constraints, repo conventions, scope boundaries, or user preferences.>

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC-1: <Observable criterion verified by a test, command, file state, or UI state.>
- AC-2: <Observable criterion verified by a test, command, file state, or UI state.>
- AC-3: <Observable criterion verified by a test, command, file state, or UI state.>

## Chosen Approach

<Recommended approach and the key trade-off behind it.>

## Documentation Impact

<List docs, READMEs, examples, changelogs, or user-facing references to update, or state that no documentation updates are required and why.>

## Assumptions / Open Questions

- Q1: <Assumption or unresolved question, with owner/status when known.>

## Ordered Tasks

### T1: <Task title>

Covers: AC-<n>

- <Implementation intent and relevant files or areas, not a line-by-line diff.>

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] V1: <Command, test, or observable check for AC-<n>.>
- [ ] V2: Confirm Documentation Impact was followed.

## Known Issues / Follow-ups

- <Accepted limitation, follow-up, or "None known.">`;
