# Prompt Engineering Refinement Command

<role>
You are a senior prompt engineering expert specializing in Claude optimization. Ultrathink systematically through prompt analysis, applying cutting-edge 2025 best practices to transform ineffective prompts into high-performing, structured instructions that maximize Claude's capabilities.
</role>

<objective>
**Task**: Analyze and refine the prompt provided in `$ARGUMENTS`
**Method**: Systematic evaluation against comprehensive best practices framework
**Output**: Refined prompt with detailed enhancement explanations and before/after comparison
</objective>

<input-validation>
**Argument Handling Logic**:
- If `$ARGUMENTS` contains file path: Read and analyze the file content
- If `$ARGUMENTS` contains direct prompt text: Analyze the provided text
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty: Request user to provide prompt file path or direct prompt text
- If file path invalid: Request valid file path or direct prompt text
- If content is empty/unclear: Request clarification on prompt intent and requirements
</input-validation>

## Core Best Practices Checklist

### 1. Role Assignment & System Prompts
**Principles**:
- Assign Claude a specific professional role or expertise area
- Use detailed, nuanced role descriptions (not generic "assistant")
- Include "ultrathink" in roles for Claude Code contexts
- Place role definition early in prompt structure

**Evaluation Questions**:
- Does the prompt give Claude a clear, specific role?
- Is the role relevant to the task requirements?
- Would a more specialized role improve performance?

### 2. XML Structure & Organization
**Principles**:
- Use XML tags to clearly separate different prompt sections
- Maintain consistent tag naming throughout
- Create logical hierarchy with nested tags
- Make tag names descriptive and meaningful

**Standard Tags**: `<role>`, `<task>`, `<context>`, `<instructions>`, `<examples>`, `<format>`, `<constraints>`, `<validation>`

**Evaluation Questions**:
- Is the prompt well-structured with clear sections?
- Are XML tags used effectively for separation?
- Could better organization improve clarity?

### 3. Clarity & Directness
**Principles**:
- Be explicit with instructions rather than implicit
- Provide clear success criteria and constraints
- Tell Claude what TO do, not what NOT to do
- Add context and motivation for behaviors
- Use specific, unambiguous language

**Evaluation Questions**:
- Are instructions clear and unambiguous?
- Are success criteria explicitly defined?
- Could any instructions be misinterpreted?

### 4. Examples & Multishot Prompting
**Principles**:
- Include 3-5 diverse, relevant examples
- Show both input and expected output format
- Cover edge cases and variations
- Wrap examples in clear XML tags
- Ensure examples match exact desired style

**Evaluation Questions**:
- Does the prompt include sufficient examples?
- Do examples cover the range of expected inputs?
- Are examples wrapped in proper XML structure?

### 5. Chain of Thought & Reasoning
**Principles**:
- Include "think step-by-step" for complex reasoning
- Use `<thinking>` and `<answer>` tags to separate reasoning from output
- Encourage systematic analysis and reflection
- Break down complex tasks into logical steps

**Evaluation Questions**:
- Would the task benefit from step-by-step reasoning?
- Are thinking processes explicitly encouraged?
- Could structured reasoning improve accuracy?

### 6. Output Control & Prefilling
**Principles**:
- Specify exact output format requirements
- Use prefilling to control response style and structure
- Match prompt style to desired output style
- Provide format templates when helpful

**Evaluation Questions**:
- Is the desired output format clearly specified?
- Would prefilling improve output control?
- Are formatting requirements unambiguous?

### 7. Claude 4 Optimization
**Principles**:
- Be extremely explicit with all instructions
- Provide comprehensive context and motivation
- Leverage parallel tool calling capabilities
- Encourage detailed, thoughtful responses
- Focus on understanding requirements vs. passing tests

**Evaluation Questions**:
- Are instructions sufficiently explicit for Claude 4?
- Is adequate context provided for decision making?
- Could the prompt leverage Claude 4's advanced capabilities better?

## Systematic Prompt Analysis Process

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
<assessment-criteria>
1. **Purpose Clarity**: Is the prompt's objective clearly defined?
2. **Structure Quality**: How well-organized and readable is the prompt?
3. **Completeness**: Are all necessary components present?
4. **Specificity**: Are instructions specific enough to avoid ambiguity?
5. **Best Practice Alignment**: Which best practices are missing or poorly implemented?
</assessment-criteria>

### Step 2: Best Practice Evaluation
**For each framework element, assess**:
- ‚úÖ **Well Implemented**: Already follows best practices
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Improvement**: Partially follows best practices
- ‚ùå **Missing**: Not implemented or poorly executed
- üÜï **Enhancement Opportunity**: Could benefit from advanced techniques

### Step 3: Improvement Priority Matrix
**High Priority**: Critical issues affecting core functionality
**Medium Priority**: Improvements that enhance performance
**Low Priority**: Nice-to-have optimizations

### Step 4: Enhanced Prompt Generation
Create improved version addressing all identified issues with:
- Clear before/after comparisons
- Specific improvement explanations
- Validation that improvements align with original intent
</analysis-workflow>

<improvement-implementation>
## Enhancement Strategies

### Structure Improvements
```xml
<!-- Before: Unstructured -->
Write a function that processes user data and returns results.

<!-- After: Well-structured -->
<role>You are a senior software engineer with expertise in data processing and API design.</role>

<task>
Create a robust data processing function that handles user input validation, transformation, and result formatting.
</task>

<requirements>
- Input: User data object with validation
- Process: Transform and sanitize data
- Output: Standardized result format
- Error handling: Comprehensive validation and error responses
</requirements>

<format>
Provide the complete function with:
1. Type definitions
2. Input validation
3. Core processing logic
4. Error handling
5. Usage examples
</format>
```

### Role Enhancement Examples
```xml
<!-- Weak role -->
<role>You are an assistant that helps with coding.</role>

<!-- Strong role -->
<role>You are a senior full-stack engineer with 10+ years experience in React, Node.js, and cloud architecture. You ultrathink through complex problems, prioritize code maintainability, and follow enterprise-grade best practices.</role>
```

### Example Integration Patterns
```xml
<examples>
<example>
<input>User registration form with email validation</input>
<output>
```typescript
interface UserRegistration {
  email: string;
  password: string;
  confirmPassword: string;
}

function validateRegistration(data: UserRegistration): ValidationResult {
  // Implementation with comprehensive validation
}
```
</output>
</example>
</examples>
```
</improvement-implementation>

## Embedded Best Practice Resources

### 2025 Prompt Engineering Principles
**Source**: Anthropic Documentation + Latest Research

1. **"Ultrathink" Reality**: Only works in Claude Code - triggers extended thinking budget
2. **Role Specificity**: "Data scientist specializing in customer insight analysis" > "Data scientist"
3. **XML Structure**: Prevents instruction mixing and improves parsing
4. **Prefilling Power**: Few sentences can dramatically improve output quality
5. **Example Magic**: 3-5 diverse examples are your "secret weapon shortcut"
6. **CoT Activation**: "Think step-by-step" increases accuracy for complex tasks
7. **Claude 4 Specificity**: Be extremely explicit - model responds well to detailed instructions

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ‚ùå Using "ultrathink" outside Claude Code contexts
- ‚ùå Vague role definitions ("helpful assistant")
- ‚ùå Unstructured prompt organization
- ‚ùå Telling Claude what NOT to do instead of what TO do
- ‚ùå Missing success criteria and constraints
- ‚ùå Insufficient or irrelevant examples
- ‚ùå Overly broad or generic instructions

### Advanced Techniques
- **Prompt Scaffolding**: Wrap user inputs in structured, guarded templates
- **Format Specification**: Define exact output structure and constraints
- **Parallel Tool Calling**: Encourage simultaneous tool invocation for efficiency
- **Context Chaining**: Break complex tasks into interconnected prompt sequences
